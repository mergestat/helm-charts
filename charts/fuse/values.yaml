    ## @param auth.existingSecret Name of existing secret to use for PostgreSQL credentials. The secret must contain the keys `postgres-password` (which is the password for "postgres" admin user), `password` (which is the password for the custom user to create when `auth.username` is set) and `replication-password` (which is the password for replication user). `auth.postgresPassword`, `auth.password`, and `auth.replicationPassword` will be ignored and picked up from this secret. The secret might also contains the key `ldap-password` if LDAP is enabled. `ldap.bind_password` will be ignored and picked from this secret in this case.
    ## The value is evaluated as a template.
